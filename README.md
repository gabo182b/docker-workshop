# docker-workshop

This project consist of a frontend(created with reactjs) and a backend(created with nodejs and expressjs) which draw colored squares in the browser to put into practice the knowledge acquired in the talks given by @abrahamjoc about Docker.

In this project we build images optimizing the latency, size of the image and code security, push them to dockerhub, pull them, and created an docker-compose file to define the services we nedeed including diferenet tests with docker volumes (tmpfs mount, volume, bind mount)

To try the project clone the repository and run the command => docker compose up

The images provided for the project are in my dockerhub profile
